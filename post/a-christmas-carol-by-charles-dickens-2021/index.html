    <p>I have endeavoured in this ghostly little book, to raise the ghost of an idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it. Charles dickens wrote a christmas carol in six weeks during october and november 1843, and the novella (technically, it is not counted among his novels) appeared just in time for christmas, on 19 december.</p>
